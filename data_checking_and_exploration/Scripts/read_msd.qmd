read_msd() should read and unzip your data source, allowing you to save it as a dataframe. It's [source](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/gophr) is filepublic, and so is the [documentation](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/gophr/reference/index.html).

First load the package and a couple other packages

```{r chunk-label, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = false}
library(gagglr)
```

Identify the name of the latest PSNU x IM MER Structured Data Set

```{r}
file <- glamr::return_latest("../Data/", "PSNU_IM_FY20")
```

Read MSD

```{r}
mer_df <- read_msd(fil2, save_rds = FALSE, remove_txt = FALSE)
```
